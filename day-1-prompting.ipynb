You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n","\n","\n","## Before you begin\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n","\n","* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n","* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n","* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n","\n","\n","## For help\n","\n","**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n","\n","### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n","\n","In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n","\n","Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n","\n","AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n","\n","If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied

He lived a comfortable life, a pampered house cat, but his spirit yearned for more than naps and sunbeams. He dreamed of adventure, of exploring the vast unknown beyond his backyard. \n","\n","One morning, while the sun painted the sky with gold and his human, Emily, was busy with her breakfast, Jasper spotted something curious. A small, brown squirrel, the bravest of its kind, was peering from a hole in the old oak tree. Its eyes met Jasper's, and a silent invitation passed between them.  \n","\n","Jasper knew what he had to do. He crept towards the oak, the rustling of fallen leaves barely audible.  He shimmied up the trunk, his claws finding purchase on the rough bark. When he reached the squirrel, it scurried up higher, beckoning him. The squirrel, his name was Nutty, led him through a labyrinth of branches, revealing a hidden world beyond the confines of Emily’s garden.\n","\n","A bustling world awaited him. Tiny creatures scurried and flew, the air thick with the hum of a thousand lives. Nutty introduced him to a quirky cast of characters: Penelope the robin, whose red breast was always puffed with gossip, and Bartholomew, the wise old owl, who perched on a high branch, watching with his amber eyes. Jasper learned about hidden springs and secret paths, about the dangers of stray dogs and the sweet nectar hidden in the heart of wildflowers.\n","\n","Days turned into weeks, and Jasper was caught in a whirlwind of adventure. He learned to climb and stalk, to navigate the labyrinth of the woods and the dangers of the urban jungle. He had chased butterflies with wings as delicate as stained glass, shared berries with the mischievous chipmunks, and learned the song of the wind whistling through the trees. \n","\n","He missed Emily, her gentle touch and the warmth of her lap. But there was something else in the heart of the forest, something he hadn't expected: a sense of belonging, of purpose, of a life beyond the mundane.\n","\n","Then one day, the familiar scent of Emily's lavender soap hit him.
